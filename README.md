## Scenario 

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You made it! After graduating from the Interactive Multimedia & Design (IMD) program you were immediately hired by a small but up-and-coming Creative Agency called the Shinra Creative Company (SCC).

And before you even adjusted the height of your office's new standing desk to the way that you like it, your Team Lead tells you that Shinra Creative has a client that needs a new website. 

Your Team Lead introduces you to Aeris, the new client, and asks you to design a website and create a presentation that not only presents the website design to the client, but also demonstrates a detailed analysis of: 

* the users of the website, 
* the key problem(s) that they are experiencing, 
* the tasks that they are looking to accomplish on this site
* how the website design solves the task 

## Client details 

The client's name is Aeris, beyond that, you are empowered to make up any other details that you need about the client. 

For example, if you would like to design a site for a non-profit food bank, then you could assume Aeris is a program director at a local Food Bank. If you want to design a protfolio site, then you can say that Aeris is a successful designer with a healthy amount of completed projects under her belt. If you wanted to design a website that markets a video game, you could say Aeris is a marketing manager at a game company that is looking for web design support.

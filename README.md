## TLDR

1. Write a report that showcases your website design, describes your client, the users of the website, and the results of guerilla user testing

## Description

Create a report that includes:

* a short description of your client,
* a high fidelity web page design for a homepage or landing page (desktop or mobile),
* research conducted about your client's users,
  * who are the users of the website, 
  * the key problem(s) that the users are experiencing,
  * the tasks that they are looking to accomplish on this site
  * how your website design addresses these tasks
* the results of your guerilla user testing 

## Client details 

You are empowered to invent as many details as you need about your client.

For example, if you would like to design a website for a non-profit food bank, then you could assume your client is a program director at a local Food Bank. If you want to design a portfolio site, then you can say that your client is a successful designer with a healthy amount of completed projects under their belt. If you wanted to design a website that markets a video game, you could say your client is a marketing manager at a game company that is looking for web design support.
